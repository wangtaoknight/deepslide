## Usage
* To start the software, please run the script `DFDL_start.m`
* The main files implementing the algorithms are `DFDL.m`

## Sample dataset 
A _reduced_ version of ADL-Kidney dataset could be downloaded from:
    http://signal.ee.psu.edu/dfdl/ADL_Kidney_reduce.zip

## Requirements 
This version of DFDL has only been tested on MATLAB R2011a or later and all of 
our testing was done on the Windows 7 platform.

## Reporting errors 
* This code is still in development stage; any comments or bug reports are very welcome.
* If you encounter any bugs in my code, please report an issue [here](https://github.com/tiepvupsu/DFDL/issues). I'll try to fix them as soon as possible. 

## Review and rate my DFDL
* Please [rate and review](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57181-tiepvupsu-dfdl) to make the DFDL better. Thank you so much.
